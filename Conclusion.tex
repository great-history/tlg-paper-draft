In conclusion, this work reveals the highly tunable properties in tri-layer ABA graphene by hydrostatic pressure. 
It is seen that not only the hopping parameters can be tuned by pressure directly, but the phase diagram in the low magnetic field can also have a significant change. 
These phenomena demonstrate that tri-layer ABA graphene can be a high-tunable platform for band engineering and a variety of phases with pressurization. 
It is the emergence of the "Quantum Parity Hall state," which is a helical edge state with two pairs of counter-propagating edge modes. 
Moreover, several novel states are favoured by different energy scales at the charge neutrality point. 
However, there are still some questions which still need to be answered. 
The first one is about what the nature of the phase B. 
In order to answer it, it is necessary to use the temperature-varied and tilted magnetic field transport measurement to get a more detailed understanding of the competition between different energy scales. 
Since the perpendicular magnetic field controls the exchange effects and the LL degeneracies, they may play an important role in determining the phase diagram, 
revealing the complex Landau-level structure of tri-layer ABA graphene. 
We hope our experimental results can trigger some theoretical and experimental interests to investigate it deeper.
