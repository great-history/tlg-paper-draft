    Multi-layer graphene systems are promising platforms to study interesting physical phenomena, 
    including unique quantum hall physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and topological properties. 
    Here, by applying hydrostatic pressure on the tri-layer ABA graphene, 
    the phase diagram at the charge neutrality point undergoes a significant change, 
    indicating a complicated interplay among different energy scales. 
    Also, quantum parity hall state, a kind of helical edge state protected by mirror symmetry, emerges after pressure.
    The measured Landau Fan diagram illustrates the modification of the band structure by pressure, 
    which can be used to explain the observed phenomenon.
